# About Me

I am a data scientist with a PhD in Electrical Engineering and expertise in machine/deep learning, statistical analysis, and probabilistic modeling. My current research focuses on developing predictive models for medical applications, such as cardiac motion modeling and reconstruction of 3D+t CT volumes from 2D+t X-ray projections acquired during radiotherapy. I have experience analyzing large-scale population datasets and utilizing various data analytics techniques to extract insights from complex data.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an enthusiastic learner and always open to exploring new technologies and approaches. I am also committed to contributing to the data science community.
